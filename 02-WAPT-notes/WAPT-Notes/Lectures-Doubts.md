Q : couldn't able to open this room because this room is private
    Even i open the BurpSuite room in tryhackme , BurpSuite Room section is divided into individual rooms based on topics 
    & only starting first 2 rooms are free & rest are paid to do, This is the issue i am facing

- Lecture 3 : 
```
1) Finding the server
2) Loading some content
    Q : diff. b/w server vs web server 
    Ans : https://www.perplexity.ai/search/difference-between-server-vM7DAFvPRterYLukvuiCGw
        - Server: 
            Imagine a server like a big box that stores and shares information. 
            It's like a giant library that keeps books safe and lets people borrow them when needed.
        - Web Server:
            Now, think of a web server as a special type of server that focuses on websites.
            It's like a library that specifically holds books about different topics that people can read online.
        - Purpose:
            A server can store all kinds of information, like books, 
            while a web server is more like a library dedicated to online books (websites).
        - Access:
            Just like u need a library card to borrow books, computers need permission to access servers. 
            Web servers are like libraries with online memberships for websites.
    Q : why HTTP comes with GET request
    Q : diff b/w sniffing vs spoofing

### More HTTP - Verbs/methods & requests formats
    Q : why body section doesn't come in GET request 
        Ans : 
    Q : when body section comes with GET request - then why body section is skipped by the server
        Ans : 
    Q : in which case , body section will come with GEt request
        Ans : 

    Q : why body section will comes with POST request to the server
        Ans : cuz eg : we're loginIn instagram , so this request will be POST request 
            & whatever u filled inside the loginIn page - will be considered as sensitive data
            that's why that data comes inside body section
            request = POST request + data comes inside = body section => that's why body section comes with POST request
    
    Q : define Accept-Encoding in HTTP request
        Ans: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/whats-AcceptEncoding-in-vqQ.HNktRta4Wf0N6wrERQ
