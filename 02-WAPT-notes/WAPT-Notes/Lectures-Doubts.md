Q : couldn't able to open this room because this room is private
    Even i open the BurpSuite room in tryhackme , BurpSuite Room section is divided into individual rooms based on topics 
    & only starting first 2 rooms are free & rest are paid to do, This is the issue i am facing 

    in tryhackme , i found these room for web fundamentals

    2. https://tryhackme.com/room/httpindetail
    3. https://tryhackme.com/room/dnsindetail

    Note : further rooms for BurpSuite are paid 

    Current Status About Me : i started your WAPT playlist & i am thinking to do those stuff 
        what i can do until i don't get reply from me , so waiting for reply 

    So like should I spend money on these or not or should i go for alternatives
Ans : you can buy tryhackme subscription for 1 month and do these paid rooms.It will be worth it.
    
    Q : Ok sir but in tryhackme , there are 2 different rooms for web fundamentals
       1. https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/web (i think this is a complete course of WAPT according to your WAPT lectures)
       2. https://tryhackme.com/r/room/webfundamentals (this is a individual module)

    Which one should I buy for 1month subscription? Let me know.

## Lectures Doubts

```
- Lecture 3 : 
```
1) Finding the server
2) Loading some content
    Q : diff. b/w server vs web server 
    Ans : https://www.perplexity.ai/search/difference-between-server-vM7DAFvPRterYLukvuiCGw
        - Server: 
            Imagine a server like a big box that stores and shares information. 
            It's like a giant library that keeps books safe and lets people borrow them when needed.
        - Web Server:
            Now, think of a web server as a special type of server that focuses on websites.
            It's like a library that specifically holds books about different topics that people can read online.
        - Purpose:
            A server can store all kinds of information, like books, 
            while a web server is more like a library dedicated to online books (websites).
        - Access:
            Just like you need a library card to borrow books, computers need permission to access servers. 
            Web servers are like libraries with online memberships for websites.
    Q : why HTTP comes with GET request
    Q : diff b/w sniffing vs spoofing
