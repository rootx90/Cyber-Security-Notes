### Homework
- learn more about Nmap - cuz in course , we saw only overview practical of it <br>- go to kali -> go in terminal -> run `nmap -h` -> then learn about all the commands for scanning (eg : u'll see timescan)
- do the enumeration in windowsOS <br>- download windows7 -> turn OFF its firewall -> then do scanning based the service <br>- also u can use "legion" tool for scanning

### Resources
- Advice : <br>1) ur need is to read them one by one & one by one apply in ur PC - instead of collecting those resources <br>- in 24hrs , u can get many different knowledge , so don't just collect resources <br>2) after every 3yrs , things will change completely - so keep ur knowledge up to date <br>- like blockchain technology came , IOT , cloud-computing , etc <br>- in this or any field , if keep learning for 10yrs - then still u'll not able to master that field - u just need focus on what u're learning to earn <br>- & in Forensics , only tools will change - not the knowledge <br>3) in CEH , u learn holistically <br>- but when u enter in a specific field , then u have to keep the knowledge related to that specific field <br>like WAPT - so mostly web knowledge imp
- Telegram -> search "CEH ECouncil content of any version like v12" -> u'll get books , PDF
- Download advance courses from this website : https://hide01.ir <br>- u can download CEHv12 ECcouncil , CHFI ECouncil , etc
