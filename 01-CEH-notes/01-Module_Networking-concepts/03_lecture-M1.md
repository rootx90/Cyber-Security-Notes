---
### how internet works ?
- who give us internet ? Ans : ISP , Eg : jio
- so when jio or any other ISP launch then they know that many internet gonna connect with us to use our internet
	- so they buy a range of IP addresses for Eg : let's say `Jio`<br>![](03_lecture-0-M1.jpg)
	- this is just an example but those ISP companies take a v large range of IP addresses <br>Ques : now tell are these IP address Private or Public IP address (bought by ISP companies for their network users) <br>Hint : when a ISP provide internet to u then where u connect that internet ? Ans : WWW <br>Ans : in WWW , which IP address is used - mean in WAN - i.e public IP address ✔
	- so those are Public IP addresses which are bought by IPS like Jio ✔ <br>so the IP address which is allotted via ISP - that IP address is public IP ✔
	- then u purchase a "router" , let's say a "Jio router" <br>& now our ISP - given one IP address to each internet users from that range (which they bought) for the router ✔ <br>Eg : let's say , Jio ISP gave an `205.120.234.20` IP address to the router <br>![](03_lecture-1-M1.jpg)
	- & this is a Public IP address which is given to ur router ✔ <br>Now at our home , a broadband installed - broadband means internet
	- Conclusion : now our Jio ISP gave a Public IP address to ur router & now broadband is installed <br>Ques : what u do after once broadband i setup completely at ur home ? (just skip the process of password) - just tell directly what would u do <br>Ans : u simply directly connect with different devices with the router 
	- so we'll also directly connect different devices with the router like phone , PC , lapi <br>now tell me that router also a device - means router also gonna talk with those different devices (which u connected) ✔ like this <br> ![](03_lecture-2-M1.jpg)
	- & even those devices will talk to the router ✔ , so these devices need their own IP address - so that router can talk <br>& router has it's Public IP
	- so the way "ISP jio" knows that many internet users gonna use their internet , so ISP Jio provided <br>a Public IP address to the router - that's why "ISP jio" kept a large range of different IP addresses for their internet users <br>so same way - the router also knows itself that atleast 15-20 devices will connect with it , so that's why - the router also <br>kept a range of IP address for those devices ✔ like this <br>![](03_lecture-3-M1.jpg)
	- so here we're assuming a range of IP addresses of router - starting IP address is `192.168.1.0` till end `200.200.200.200` <br>& any router doesn't give any IP address which start or end only with 0 (zero) cuz these IP addresses are reserved by router for something else <br>but don't focus on the range of IP addresses of router - "just focus on understanding the concept" ✔ <br>so that much range of IP addresses - the router kept with itself
	- Now when no. of devices connect with the router then the router will give unique IP addresses (out of those range) to each connected devices ✔ <br>let's say a phone connected - so it'll get IP address & same process continue for connected devices like this <br>![](03_lecture-4-M1.jpg)
	- so these devices got the IP address , don't think about why IP address are in sequence which are given to them - these are assumption
	- Ques : tell that the range of IP addresses - that router have are private or public IPs ? <br>Ans : So those IP addresses are Private cuz router comes in LAN network ✔
	- Now each IP addresses which is given to each devices are Private IP addresses <br>& the IP address that the router got from ISP i.e Public IP address <br>so acc. to rule , Public IP can talk to Public IP only & Private IP can only talk to Private IP &<br>the Private IP can't take to the Public IP & vice versa ✔
	- that's why , the Router will keep/take the first IP address from the range (whatever the range - a router have) <br>- so always the router kept with itself the 1st IP address from the range i.e `192.158.1.1` ⭐ like this <br>![](03_lecture-5-M1.jpg)
	- Now the Router have 2 different types of IP addresses i.e left one is Public IP & right one in Private IP ✔ <br>Now acc. to rule , the Private IP address can't to the Public IP & vice versa 
	- so assume google's server IP address is `4.4.4.4` & the server has a public static IP address ✔<br>& the router have 2 different types of IP i.e Public & private IP
	- So Now , let's say device who have `192.168.1.2` IP address want to talk with google server IP i.e `4.4.4.4` for resources <br>so firstly , this device will search like `google.com` & a packet will generate & the packet will go to the router <br>So acc. to rule , the Private IP can talk to only Private IP , so that packet will go the private IP of the router i.e `192.168.1.1`<br>cuz the Private IP of that device i.e `192.168.1.2` can't directly talk to the Public IP of the router i.e `205.120.234.20`<br>so the packet will go to the the router's Private IP of  i.e `192.168.1.1` & then the router will switch from it's own <br>a Private IP (`192.168.1.1`) into the Public IP (`205.120.234.20`) ✔
		- Cuz the router has a inbuild feature to switch/convert it's own - a Private IP into Public IP & vice versa - for communication <br>cuz a private IP can't directly talk to Public IP & vice versa - that's why ✔
		- so router is a intermediator , so it'll switch from a Private IP to a Public IP & vice versa <br> ![](03_lecture-6-M1.jpg)
- Ques : Now tell me how many identities that the router have ? <br>Ans : so a Public IP , a Private IP & the router is a hardware - so MAC address also a identity , so total 3 identities ✔ 
- Now the devices which are connected , let's say one of them - how many identities a device have ? <br>1) a Private IP address <br>2) a MAC address <br>3) a localhost
	- What is Localhost ? <br>Ans : just like we said a Public IP - is a real name of a person & a private IP is a nick of a person <br>so same way , a localhost - is like a brain of a person , so let's say - whatever u think/thoughts in ur brain, <br>so those thinking process or thoughts - remain inside ur brain - those stuff doesn't go outside <br>or nobody can't understand about ur thoughts or thinking process <br>- so we're doing self-routing or self-communication or self-talk ✔
	- in a System (let's say a Laptop or a phone) IP of localhost `imp ⭐` : `127.0.0.1` & the localhost's domain is `localhost` ✔
	- purpose of it : in ur device (like lapi, phone, PC) , the localhost used for self-testing <br>so the localhost is the 3rd identity ✔
	- so let's say - the monitor has 3rd identity i.e the localhost
	- by Default , IP address of the localhost for any device is same i.e `127.0.0.1` ✔
	- About localhost we'll learn further later on
- 1.2) Source vs Destination
	- source : means starting point : means from we're going & <br>Destination : means ending point : means where we want to reach
	- Ques : if u want to go from Jodhpur to jaipur , so what's source & the destination <br>Ans : Jodhpur - is source & jaipur - is destination <br>if u want to come back from jaipur to Jodhpur , so jaipur - is source & Jodhpur - is destination ✔
	- Ques : find out Source & destination <br>![](03_lecture-7-M1.jpg)
	- Eg : let's take - Monitor device , so let's say this device search for google & a packet gets generated & goes to the google <br>So now tell what is source & destination - step by step
	- situation 1 : a packet request from the monitor to the google public static IP 
		- STEP 1 : a packet going from the monitor to the router , tell what's the source & the destination <br>source - `192.168.1.3` Private IP of the device , destination - the router who has a private IP i.e `192.168.1.1`
		- STEP 2 : now the router send that packet request to the google public static IP <br>here Source - is the router's public IP address i.e `205.120.234.20` <br>(cuz the router will switch the IP address due to the "Private & Public IP communication rule")<br>Destination - `4.4.4.4` public static IP of google (assume that IP)
	- situation 2 : now google got that packet request , now google will reply
		- STEP 1 : a response of that packet will go from google to the router <br>Source - `4.4.4.4` public static IP of google (assume that IP) <br>Destination - is the router's public IP address i.e `205.120.234.20` 
		- STEP 2 : a response of that packet will go from the router to that monitor device <br>here Source - is the router's public IP address i.e `102.168.1.1` <br>(cuz here the router will switch the IP address due to the "Private & Public IP communication rule" i.e <br>the Public IP to the Private IP of the router)<br>Destination - `4.4.4.4` public static IP of google (assume that IP)
- `Repeating above stuff again for understanding new concepts` : <br>Now understand the concept story again , we purchased a router & with the router - we got a Public IP address <br>that Public IP address given by the ISP & this Public IP address is dynamic (means when u close the router/sim of phone <br>then start it again then that Public IP address will get changed) ✔
	- when u purchase the router , then only one Public IP address we'll get - same with SIM for phone <br>& the router also want to talk to those devices , so the router also kept a range of IP addresses to connect with those devices <br>but that range of IP addresses are Private IP addresses
	- & in that range of Private IP addresses of the router , the router will keep a 1st Private IP address with itself (out of that range) <br>for communication with those devices - means the router will not give that 1st IP address to any devices <br>which want to connect with the router✔
	- Now once everything connected then the router got 3 identities i.e <br>1) a private IP address (from the range of private IP addresses of the router) <br>2) a Public IP address (got from the ISP) <br>3) a MAC address of the router
	- & each of those devices have total 3 identities i.e <br>1) a Private IP address <br>2) a MAC address <br>3) a localhost
	- Now the range is network is created around those devices are not bigger & each devices got Private IPs ✔
		- Ques : which range of network is this - LAN or WAN ? <br>Ans : means this network range will come in LAN network , so these are devices are connected & forming a LAN network <br>where 5-10 devices are connected with the router
		- Ques : the public IP of the router (which is got from the ISP) connected with google server <br>so the router's Public IP is connecting with the google (which is spread all over the world) <br>Ans : so the network is formed from the google to the router's Public IP i.e WAN network
		- So in LAN network , only Private IP addresses used for communication<br>& in WAN network , only Public IP addresses used for communication <br>acc. to that Private vs Public IP communication rule
		- Pic of which is creating WAN & LAN network : <br>![](03_lecture-8-M1.jpg)
	- this is how Internet works 
	- so the router's Public IP address (which got from the ISP) will change when u off the wifi - which we saw in practical 
		- so Public IP address (of the router) is changing cuz it's dynamic Public IP address ✔
		- & the router - which gave each Private IP address to each devices - will not change directly <br>means when someone's system connect with in ur system then u'll get a different Private IP <br>`Note ✅` : but generally this doesn't happen cuz the router kept a large range of Private IP addresses <br>& there's no need to change also & it's also a Dynamic Private IP address
- 2 ways to give/assign IP address to give to the system & features of router i.e DHCP vs ARP
	- Ques : when the router was giving the IP address to each devices then <br>did we manually fill/define the IP address for each devices ? <br>Ans : No , then how each devices got their IP address ✔
	- So there're 2 ways to give/assign IP address to the system/device <br>1) Manual <br>2) automation
	- 1) in Manually , we define the IP address for that system & then we save <br>but cons of this way i.e what if that same IP address have already in a different device <br>then we couldn't able to use that IP address ✔
	- 2) in automation way , there's a `DHCP` which is a feature/friend of the router <br>DHCP (Dynamically Host Configuration Protocol) 
		- So Purpose of DHCP : 
			- when one by one devices/systems started connecting with the router <br>then the DHCP - one by one assign/give an IP address to each devices which are connected to the router ✔
			- Eg : let's say - that phone/device is connected with the router <br>& the device got a Private IP address via DHCP i.e `192.168.1.2` ✔ <br>then after sometime that device got disconnected , so `192.168.1.2` IP address gets free <br>& if any other device will connect to the router then that IP address will be assign/given to that device/system ✔
			- So purpose/work of DHCP is to assign/give an IP address ✔
		- so we don't have to manually define/give an IP address to each devices which are getting connected with the router
	- ARP
		- How DHCP able to know that which IP address of which system of is free <br>whether that System is connected or not <br>but DHCP only do work related to assign IP only , not more than this ✔
		- Eg : in a company , we have an account , sales <br>so Sales team - only sale things - so sales is DHCP <br>but account - keep the data of "kisco kitney paise diya" , where money goes , how much to give to that person<br>which person have to give money , which person gave the money , etc <br>so account - is ARP ✔
		- so the router has another feature i.e ARP (address resolution protocol)
		- Broadcast : Broadband (means router/internet) but broadcast - means sending a message <br>to everyone who is connected for that work , so ARP also same as broadcast ✔
		- Purpose of ARP : it ask a question from each system after small time gap <br>means it sends a packet to each system & let's say ARP will ask a question via sending a packet from that phone device <br>& that packet contain `Who has 192.168.1.2 IP address - tell 192.168.1.1` , <br>so that Packet of ARP means any device who have that IP address - tell to the 1st IP address router i.e `192.168.1.1` IP <br>so that router of `192.168.1.1` IP able to know that u're that device ✔
			- so `1st Work of ARP` : send a packet to each devices which are connected to the router <br>or u can say broadcast a packet to each devices ✔
			- `2nd work of ARP` : & if any device have that IP address then that device will tell <br>to the 1st IP address (which is a Private IP of the router) (out of the range of IP address) of the router<br>Note : here that device will not broadcast itself (who have that IP address) that "i'm the one" <br>so the broadcast message will not send by that device (who have that IP address) to the router ✔
			- So ARP message this Who has `Who has 192.168.1.2 | tell 192.168.1.1` <br> ![](03_lecture-9-M1.jpg)
		- & DHCP & ARP - are the inbuilt features of the router
		- so ARP - will send a packet to each devices who are connected to the router by broadcasting that packet , <br>so that ASP able to know who have that IP address
		- so once ARP with broadcasting that packet to each devices <br>& then once that particular device/system (who have that IP) send a reply in a packet form <br>then that packet contain details of that device i.e MAC address , IP address ✔ <br>& then that packet goes to the Router & the router save that packet within itself
		- Now let's say that Phone device disconnected & the router broadcast a packet request to each devices <br>& but now no reply will get to the router from that phone device (cuz it's disconnected) , <br>so when no reply got from that phone device then the router will save a packet as `192.168.1.2` IP is empty ✔
			- now the router will tell to DHCP that `192.168.1.2` IP is not connected with any system - so this IP is empty <br>so DHCP will say when a new device will connect to the router then that IP address will be given to that device ✔
		- so this is a working of ARP that ✔<br>1) ARP will broadcast a packet to each system <br>2) & each system will reply but if that system is not connected (who have that IP address) <br>then no reply will get from that system to the router 
		- Now whatever explain we did yet for ARP - is for in LAN network <br>in WAN network , so when that device/system do google search for a packet/data <br>then the router knows that device of `192.168.1.2` IP did a packet/data search of google.com to access<br>but when a reply/response come from the google then the router know the IP address only of that system <br>but the router doesn't know which system have that `192.168.1.2` IP - means the router not able to identify the device ✔
			- means : (router only known that device `192.168.1.2` IP did a packet search but the router doesn't know which system have that IP address) ✔
			- that's why with IP address , MAC address of that system transferred by ARP to the router <br>eg : with aadhar card , PAN card also used cuz both have different use case ✔
			- so in this case , the router will broadcast that packet response via ARP again <br>& ARP will get ON then ARP will send that packet request to each devices - in order to know <br>which device have that IP address , so that device will respond/say that "i have that IP" ✔
			- then the router - will send that Packet response/reply to that device ✔
		- this is complete functionality of a Public IP , Private IP , total identities of a device , localhost , where a public IP is getting used - WAN or LAN ? <br>to connect with a world - Public IP used & within range - to connect devices (which are present in our range i.e LAN) - here for communication - Private IP used ✔
		- `3rd work of ARP` : whatever the configuration need to be done for the router - like changing the password , any configuration related to the router 
			- so configuration of the router done on this IP address : http://192.168.1.1/ - which is default IP address of any router
			- so when u open the router login then `DHCP` shows IP addresses which are assigned to each devices , etc..
			- due to 2-3 reasons , the 1st IP address are by-default given to the router

### Example : 
lecture (30-oct-2023) - all about ports & protocols (timestamp 4:17 - 6:55)
- let's say Devendra Sir - is currently in Rajasthan & u're in delhi
- so Devendra sir's system IP is 192.168.1.20 (private IP of the router) & <br>his router's have 2 IP i.e 3.3.3.3 (public IP of the router) & 192.168.1.1 (Private IP of the router)
- & u'r  system's IP is 4.4.4.4
- Ques : & u want to connect with sir then which IP will be shared 
	- Pic <br>![](03_lecture-10-M1.jpg)
	- i.e 3.3.3.3 - cuz it's a Public IP address of the router which is used in WAN network <br>& 192.168.1.20 <br>- is Private IP of the system of sir & this IP address doesn't go outside of the LAN network <br>- means this IP address limited around the router connection

### End of the lecture
- 1) timeline 7:01 - 7:38
	- don't go in doubt session until u don't have doubt cuz there , many weird doubts come & mostly people ask advance doubts <br>& u'll not understand + u'll also waste ur time too
	- first try to solve ur doubts my urself then come if still u have doubts
	- mine conclusion : don't do advance or extra stuff on something else , just clear & learn concepts that u taught till yet & ask doubts from what u have learned yet
- 2) in Phone , from where it gets the IP address (cuz it's not the router) ? 
	- so phone's SIM works as a router , so a SIM has Public IP address <br>& as a SIM is working as a single router - when it's only connected with ur phone
	- but when u give hotspot to someone then ur phone becomes/behave as a router <br>& same it also keep a range of Private IP addresses & those who're connected with ur hotspot <br>all those each devices take a private IP address <br>- so the phone give a IP address to each devices i.e Private IP & the SIM has a IP address i.e Public IP
	- so whenever someone google search then the packet request goes to ur phone's private IP address <br>& the phone will send that packet request to ur phone's SIM (means router) <br>then the SIM will use the Public IP address to send that packet request to the google server's IP address
	- if ur friend or someone did a crime then the Public IP address will go of SIM ✔
	- so our phone also behaves as a router
	- Imp ⭐ : SIM = router (Public IP address) & phone = private IP address <br>so both can't be Public or Private IP address cuz communication not able to happen & system will get confuse <br>like which IP need to use for accepting the packet response & which IP will be use to send the packet request ✔
- 3) can we change the Public Static IP address
	- in further lectures , we'll see how to change it
	- but static IP address are purchased by companies , so generally - for server , companies purchase these static IP address
- 4) what if we want to convert static IP into dynamic IP ? - for this do we need to purchase
	- Yes
- 5) IP address of localhost is same ? so why IP address is allotted ? ✔
	- for self-testing 
	- let's say a outside network is not connected , then if u want to do troubleshooting <br>then how u'll do it
	- so IP address of the localhost - do self-testing on the system
- 6) in settings of the phone ? 
	- the IP address u'll find in setting of the phone i.e Static IP address
	- & if u think this static IP address is changing but it'll not change <br>& public IP address will never be shown in ur system - so u need to change on the browser ✔
- 7) `Imp ⭐` :  the range of Private IP address - that the router have
	- so these range of private IP address used for communication in LAN network
	- but these Private IP address will not used in WAN network , in WAN network - Public IP address of the router will be used ✔
	- so these private IP addresses will not go outside - means will not go in WAN network
- 8) Once online exam complete after submit , then a IP shown - so who which IP is that ?
	- that IP is their sever - on which we were giving the exam
	- & the server has a Public Static IP address 
- 9) when 2 different devices - do same google search then what happen ?
	- Eg : on keyboard , when u press two different buttons at the same time <br>then at the same time , both input will not be taken , kuch agye pechye hoga ✔
	- so when 2 different packet request goes (via 2 different devices) to the router <br>then both packet goes at the same time but they both reach gye pechye
	- so each packet request of different devices will go to same Public IP address of the router 
- 10) via Public IP address of the router , we can access everything
	- we'll see later how to do that
	- cuz actually , big things hacked by Public IP address <br>but whatever the devices are in range of a Private IP address , those things only can be hacked ✔
	- but to hack those devices which are in range of Private IP address - we need connect & be in that range/area in order to hack private IP address <br>but to hack Public IP address - we can sit any where in the world ✔
	- that's why LAN & WAN network created ✔
