### More Linux Commands
> Commands to remove errors
1) `apt update --fix-missing` : [09_lecture-M2](09_lecture-M2.md)
2) `apt install --fix-broken` : broken command mostly used with install , it'll not work with "update" Eg : `apt update --fix-broken`
	- so if running `apt install gedit` & during installation error is coming <br>means if u're installing any application/package then during installation if any error comes <br>then add `--fix-broken` otherwise don't use `--fix-broken`
	- For Eg : `apt install gedit --fix-broken`
- so whatever commands we did till yet - are going to use in daily life & these are basic commands üòä
- 3 playstore in Kali Linux <br>1) apt <br>2) browser / website of it <br>3) github
	- Q : How to download apps or chrome via browser in Kali linux
		- STEP 1 : in kali , open firefox
		- STEP 2 : search chrome download & click on link
		- Q : now how chrome knows that we need chrome for linux<br>- Which Header told to Chrome that client wants a chrome Linux version<br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-0-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/> <br>Ans : Header name is "Request Header" which told to Chrome website that client wants Linux version <br>& we learned about "Request Headers" Topic , so there we learned request packet <br>so "user agent" take our OS & brown details , that's why Chrome got to know that this person <br>installing chrome in linux
		- In Linux , only `.deb (Debian/Ubuntu)` packet supported by-default
	- How to download software/apps via github like "TBomb"
		- STEP 1 : search "tbomb github"
		- STEP 2 : go to it's github page & scroll down for download debian/linux based <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-1-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/> 
		- OR u can click on "code" button<br>> Note - no need to install Python & PIP - cuz in linux u'll get by-default<br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-2-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>
		- STEP 3 : giving root/super user permission -> `sudo su`
		- STEP 4 : git clone https://github.com/TheSpeedX/TBomb.git & hit enter
		- STEP 5 : go inside "TBomb" folder where u installed it => `cd TBomb` then do `ls` <br>Now see which file can be run i.e `bomber.py` , `TBomb.sh` <br>so we'll run TBomb.sh cuz bomber.py will via python
		- so by-default `TBomb.sh` file has executable permission but if u still want to give - then u can `chmod +x TBomb.sh`
		- STEP 6 : now to run/execute the file -> `./TBomb.sh`
		- now to run that python file - u can use `./` but mostly python required to run ".py" extension file .<br>To run  the "bomber.py" python file -> `python bomber.py`
		- & to run again either use dot backslash `./` OR `python bomber.py`
	- installing .deb package/applications
		- STEP 1 : to go in downloads folder -> `cd ..`
		- STEP 2 : to install google chrome (which is in .deb) -> `dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb` <br>Output : <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-3-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>

### Information Gathering / Footprinting & Reconnaissance
> This is a 1st step into Ethical Hacking
- Information Gathering aka Footprinting & Reconnaissance
- Q : what's Information Gathering ?<br>Ans : whenever we're attacking to someone or to hack someone  , 1st process is Information gathering <br>Q : what we do in information gathering ? <br>Ans ; we try to take out A to Z or all complete information about a Victim
- Q : importance of information Gathering<br>Ans : Story
	- let's a MNC company hired a Black Hat Hacker & company said him to hack a system <br>so that "black hat hacker" did all combinations of attack (which are related to Windows OS) whatever possible <br>But he didn't able to hack the system , so again company hired a "Ethical Hacker" <br>so this "Ethical Hacker" guy - his 1st step of hacking process - he gathered information <br>> For Eg : identify IP address running , which OS using , what are applications running on it with their versions , <br>Owner of the website , etc . So he did complete scanning <br>> so during scanning process , he got to know - that linux OS is running & in application - vftpd software <br>& it's version is 2.3.4 <br>> Now he did a search that - in this version of that application - what's the vulnerabilities . Then he got <br>a vulnerability in vftpd software & he exploited the system  <br>> then in few min/secs - he hacked the system - cuz he got to know which OS running on the system i.e linux
	-  Conclusion : <br>- "Black Hat Hacker" : neither gather any information nor run any task & he was running windows OS related attacks <br>& the system was Linux . So he never able to hack that system <br>- That's why - before hacking , Information Gathering is v imp <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-4-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>
1. Q : on which stuff we do information gathering
	1. person 
	2. company
	3. website/technology
	- so these are 3 major stuff including "System" on which we do information gathering
2. Q : what are the information which can help us to hack a Victim in "information Gathering" process
	- Ans : information gathering of a person
		- Eg : Name , mobile no. , email , age , social accounts (images , etc) ,  DOB , <br>address (Country , state , etc) , hobby + interest , friends/family , contacts , <br>Gender (it can be fake) , daily routines , Job/Business , education/Date , govt. docs (PAN , Aadhar, etc) , <br>bank accounts details (everything , loan - it use in social engineering) health issues , <br>person's background , phone + 		every technology gadgets
		- So these are the patterns related to the Victim
		- so these details help to hack a person , How ? <br>Ans : we'll try each details to find out matching password
	- information gathering of a company
		- Eg : name , docs (internal + external) + govt. docs + etc docs , employee + staff details , <br>website (domains details , etc) , location , clients , financial details , accounts details , profit/loss , <br>company shares , company vendors , contacts , company's background , type of work , <br>investors/investment , CEO of company , tech details (everything including what phone , <br>lapi , servers , etc they're using) , asset of companies , <br>data breach earlier (means is this company hacked by earlier or not) + past data breaching , <br>company's basic details (like when it started , etc) + company's branches + parent company , <br>legal actions (like what cases are going on OR any legal case happen in this company or not) <br>company's tie-up , future plans , opening & Closing timing of the company , etc
	- information gathering of a website/app or company's technology (if company is tech based)
		- Eg : website domain , Public Static IP address of the website (host , etc), Sub-Domains , owner , <br>technologies (which TechStack used to build it, SSL) , server details , How many Ports are open , <br>which OS is running on the server , on which date it gets opened , when domain license will over , <br>when this website hacked last time + with reasons , 
		- Q : why knowing traffic of a website / Importance of traffic (in a wbesite) <br>Ans : cuz For Eg : WsCubeTech has 15000 subs , so WsCubeTech has 3 sub-domains <br>i.e Vlog , courses , upload . So 800 coming on Vlog , 500 on courses , 200 on upload <br>so at the end , traffic of each sub-domain will be connected via only one server <br>so Generally , company keep that sub-domain more secure (which is getting more traffic) <br>> so attacker/hacker will find out that Sub-domain (which is getting less traffic) <br>& attacker will find out vulnerability , so if any one vulnerability got from that sub-domain <br>then via that single Sub-domain (which is getting less traffic) , all other Sub-domains will be affected + will be hacked
	- conclusion Pic : <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-5-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>
	- so these are stuff we try to find out in Information Gathering Process
3. Q : How to find out those details stuff in information Gathering
	- we have 3 sources to do Information Gathering : 
		1. search engines 
			- Eg : Q : what's a difference b/w search engines & browsers <br>Ans : Google , Yahoo , duckduckgo , etc are a search engine & chrome is a browser
			- Note : duckduckgo , Censys , Shodan , notevil  , etc - are related to Hackers search engines <br>u'll get many info on them <br>For More : <br>> [10 Best Hackers Search Engines in 2023 - GBHackers](https://gbhackers.com/10-best-hacker-friendly-search-engines-of-2023/) <br>> https://www.perplexity.ai/search/list-down-Top-6nx7lt5XR_.b71lZ4uUuLw
    	- for other 2 sources - in 11th lecture
	- firstly , we'll do information gathering via normal search engines - For Example : 
		- STEP 1 : 1st , we'll find info from the website <br>- search only "wscubetech" on google (not wscubetech.com) <br>- so acc. to our search , we'll get google map location of it , we can go to website <br>- STEP 1.1 : go to More > About Us page & scroll down - so mostly details are in "Contact Us" page <br>- in "Contact Us" page , address + mobile no. + email address are given <br>so these are the details which the company wants to tell/show
		- `Advice ‚≠ê` : in ethical hacking , never just look for info from just seeing above stuff (like <br>this company just show it's courses website cuz they want to show their website above in "search results" via SEO) <br>so always dig into deep for information gathering <br>- cuz I.G is a 1st vital step - so do it properly before doing any other steps (like scanning)
		- STEP 2 : digging into deep of the website <br>- open it's linkedin , insta , upwork , interest , medium , twitter , etc websites related that website<br>- so open those websites which are not ranked & related to wscubetech & <br>try to get information gathering related to the website <br>- from Linkedin social , u'll see many info about like how many employees currently working , etc
		- STEP 3 : & if a website asking for login - then don't login & u can close the website <br>if that website doesn't contain much info about the Victim's website <br>- if u do information gathering process on justdial about the website - then u'll get GST no. <br>- in rocketreach.co website , employees info showing of wscubetech <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-6-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>
		- in crunchbase.com website related to victim's website , in technology tab - monthly visit showing <br><img src="../notes-pics/02-Module/10_lecture/10_lecture-7-M2.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>
		- in zaubacorp.com , u'll get CIN no. , registration no. about that website
		- so these details we found via normal google search engine

### Homework
- STEP 4 : Homework for u <br>Now try to find out details about the website via using different search engines <br>& save those info in word file
- so currently u need to use "search engines" way to do information gathering about a Victim <br>in upcoming lecture , we'll see other ways
 
### End of the Lectures (Doubts) : 
- Advice : No need to install anything , when time comes for that concept then we'll install üß†
- Advice : a person asked that we saw `.py` file , so why these programming languages file made <br>Don't distract urself & it'll go out of topic if we go deep into it , <br>> In this course , Programming languages didn't use , python will be used in Penetration testing
- Advice : don't understand what was TBomb , in Lecture 9 : we were just understanding <br>how to install a package/software via Linux command , don't try to understand "what TBomb do" <br>- avoid it otherwise u'll waste ur time
