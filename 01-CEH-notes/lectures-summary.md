### End of Lectures (Doubts) summary

- Lecture 1 : Intro to Networking
```
Q : in nmap , what `-sT` means

Q : what happen if u hack someone else device without telling that person

Q : define MAC address

Q : timeline 1:16:17 - 1:17:12 - Lecture 4
    when u did airplane mode ON , then IP address gets changed 
    but what if i off the airplane mode before searching google.com & again u ON then IP address will get changed
	Q : so the new IP address that we got , so is again a new request will go from this New IP address

Q : the practical demo u saw about How to hack a system via an IP address is just a tiny example , 
    later on we'll see from scratch if u type ipconfig /all command on cmd 
    & on internet - search for my ip address then in both situation - IP address will be different why ?

Q : to become better EH , then u have to practice a lot & revise

Q : while doing that practical for hacking a system via an IP address , 
    so here comes that we need to hide our actual IP address , so that no one can find us , 
    otherwise our details also get revealed & mac address also contain details

Q : LAN port & LAN network = both are different each other

Q : in that practical demo class of hacking a system via IP address that system , so we found the port also , 
    so later on we'll learn about Ports in depth , cuz mostly attacks are depend on ports , 
    also don't need to know every ports

Q : why we can't access IP address of google instead of typing name of google , this we'll see in upcoming lecture 
    that actually behind the scene , how "google" name gets converted into IP address
Q : in Practical demo of IP address , when we access Port , a port was running a service i.e bindshell 
    - so shell means terminal & bind means joining/connecting 2 different terminals together , 
    but port 443 used for transferring & receiving the data securely , 
    so Port no. 443 will never give access to join with a terminal , so when we know working of each PORT 
    then we'll able to hack each port & Port no. 3 is HTTPs with SSL certificate

Q : in this course , we'll not see the direct way like hacking social media , 
    but u'll get complete understanding of hacking process

Q : to explain a topic , first clear the base then tell about the topic to that person

Q : in practical demo of hacking a system via IP address , so in next class , we'll see how to identify is 
    this ur IP address or not & that IP address is not of Victim

Q : phishing attack , credit card got hacked ? 
    if u give details of ur credit card on unknown website + give all OTP then ur details 
    will get taken away & hacking server of a bank is not easy - cuz server of a bank contain different types of firewall
    & 99.9% difficult to reach there

Q : anything possible to hack like bitcoin or mining in blockchain , 
    technology is decentralized which means no body is controlling
    but centralized technology eg : facebook - controlling by mark zuckerberg , 
    but in blockchain technology - there's no owner to control it , 
    so it's handled + manage + secure via people who are using them like u ,
    but in blockchain - data is not stored in one system - data is divided into multiple devices & to hack
    then u have to hack each system but to make a blockchain group , there's a "smart contract" being made
    which is same for everyone , so if "smart contract' being hacked then each system gets hacked 
    & u can hack somebody's blockchain wallet but u have to do RND

Q : mining in blockchain - required bunch of best GPU in order to hack a mining & for mining , different OS comes , 
    PC for mining will be different than ur normal PC & u can't stop that PC - cuz it should be run continuously for mining

Q : importance of VMware , due to it - data can't be harmed cuz system of VMware is different
