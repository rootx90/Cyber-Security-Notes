```
Q : in nmap , what `-sT` means

Q : what happen if u hack someone else device without telling that person

Q : define MAC address

Q : timeline 1:16:17 - 1:17:12 - Lecture 4
    when u did airplane mode ON , then IP address gets changed 
    but what if i off the airplane mode before searching google.com & again u ON then IP address will get changed
	Q : so the new IP address that we got , so is again a new request will go from this New IP address

Q : the practical demo u saw about How to hack a system via an IP address is just a tiny example , 
    later on we'll see from scratch if u type ipconfig /all command on cmd 
    & on internet - search for my ip address then in both situation - IP address will be different why ?

Q : to become better EH , then u have to practice a lot & revise

Q : while doing that practical for hacking a system via an IP address , 
    so here comes that we need to hide our actual IP address , so that no one can find us , 
    otherwise our details also get revealed & mac address also contain details

Q : LAN port & LAN network = both are different each other

Q : in that practical demo class of hacking a system via IP address that system , so we found the port also , 
    so later on we'll learn about Ports in depth , cuz mostly attacks are depend on ports , 
    also don't need to know every ports

Q : why we can't access IP address of google instead of typing name of google , this we'll see in upcoming lecture 
    that actually behind the scene , how "google" name gets converted into IP address
Q : in Practical demo of IP address , when we access Port , a port was running a service i.e bindshell 
    - so shell means terminal & bind means joining/connecting 2 different terminals together , 
    but port 443 used for transferring & receiving the data securely , 
    so Port no. 443 will never give access to join with a terminal , so when we know working of each PORT 
    then we'll able to hack each port & Port no. 3 is HTTPs with SSL certificate

Q : in this course , we'll not see the direct way like hacking social media , 
    but u'll get complete understanding of hacking process

Q : to explain a topic , first clear the base then tell about the topic to that person

Q : in practical demo of hacking a system via IP address , so in next class , we'll see how to identify is 
    this ur IP address or not & that IP address is not of Victim

Q : phishing attack , credit card got hacked ? 
    if u give details of ur credit card on unknown website + give all OTP then ur details 
    will get taken away & hacking server of a bank is not easy - cuz server of a bank contain different types of firewall
    & 99.9% difficult to reach there

Q : anything possible to hack like bitcoin or mining in blockchain , 
    technology is decentralized which means no body is controlling
    but centralized technology eg : facebook - controlling by mark zuckerberg , 
    but in blockchain technology - there's no owner to control it , 
    so it's handled + manage + secure via people who are using them like u ,
    but in blockchain - data is not stored in one system - data is divided into multiple devices & to hack
    then u have to hack each system but to make a blockchain group , there's a "smart contract" being made
    which is same for everyone , so if "smart contract' being hacked then each system gets hacked 
    & u can hack somebody's blockchain wallet but u have to do RND

Q : mining in blockchain - required bunch of best GPU in order to hack a mining & for mining , different OS comes , 
    PC for mining will be different than ur normal PC & u can't stop that PC - cuz it should be run continuously for mining

Q : importance of VMware , due to it - data can't be harmed cuz system of VMware is different 
    than ur actual system - it's like using 2 different Laptops

Q : changing location via IP address of different countries possible via VPNs & proxies 
    & how hackers are able to change the location
    - it depends on VPN or Proxies cuz like VPN has time limit to change the IP address & location

Q : Advice : nothing is secure on the internet 100%

Q : we'll make our on custom proxies not VPN - later on , 
    cuz VPN is not secure but proxy is much secure to change the IP address - which we just saw in 22)

Q : VPN & proxies are used for security purpose

Q : a VPN's companies , give same IP address which u were using at that time

Q : how to be anonymous ?

Q : if u're learning something then in 2 ways can be used bad or good , but if u don't know whatever action/steps u're 
    gonna take towards that bad thing & how that action can impactful at what percentage 
    then don't take a action/steps towards that bad thing

Q : how to access root folder of Kali

```

- Lecture 2 : Type Of Networks
```
Q : how to identify which IPv6 format correct & which one is wrong

Q : About MAC address

Q : static IP or dynamic ip , which used by normal users of internet


Q : How both IP address + MAC address (of a device) interact with the server

Q : in whatsmyipv4 website
	- but my IPv4 address is not changing when i try to do via connecting with router & disconnecting+connecting with router
		even after offing the router & on the router again
	- but when i try to do it via SIM data network then it's working - that IP was Public Dynamic IP address
	- Q : why is it like that , is my ISP provided static IP address is it so ?
	
Q : How Dynamic & why it's not changing when u did with the router

Q : Can we change the MAC address for temporary?

Q : about Port & Port no. 80

Q : mostly hacking happens on wireless devices , not on wired devices 
	& hacking wired network are easier , so that's why mostly we'll learn about wireless network
```

- Lecture 3 : How Internet Works
```
Q : in Phone , from where it gets the IP address (cuz it's not the router) ?

Q : can we change the Public Static IP address

Q : what if we want to convert static IP into dynamic IP ? - for this do we need to purchase

Q : IP address of localhost is same ? so why IP address is allotted ?

Q : in settings of the phone ?

Q : the range of Private IP address - that the router have

Q : Once online exam complete after submit , then a IP shown - so who which IP is that ?

Q : when 2 different devices - do same google search then what happen ?

Q : via Public IP address of the router , we can access everything
```

- Lecture 4 : all about Ports & protocols
```
Q : List down important ports to know as a ethical hacker

Q : http vs https | importance of https | importance of SSL/TLS certificate
Q : in https , 
    when sensitive data (like password, username) being send from client system 
    to server , then that where data embedded 
Q : is that data being embedded on body or header of a request

Q : About ARP
	Q : what is ARP in wifi-router
	Q : in wifi-router , is ARP considered as a data packet or a protocol ?
	Q : why wifi-router send ARP packet ? if wifi-router sends ARP packet then where that ARP packet goes ?
	Q : what happens when a router receives an ARP request
	Q : how does a router determine the mac address of a device
	
Q : Domain of a website - also connected with server of that website

Q : if ur ISP providing internet to u then whatever searches u're doing - are they able to read my searches data ?

Q : which protocol mostly used to make establish connection between 2 systems
	like when a client system talk to any server in this world - is that protocol TCP or something else
	
Q : without Port , no data can be transferred , so Ports is everywhere
```
